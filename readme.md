# Ticketmaster API
In this project I render events based on what i fetch with Ticketmaster API. Each event is represented as a card. The website is responsive. The API key is hidden. 

## MVP
MVP for me is understandable code and beeing able to fetch events and present it in html.

## Roadmap 
- When on bottom get more events
- Choose city for the events
- Add map for the event location
